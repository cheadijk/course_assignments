## **Introduction to Pseudocode and Logical Thinking**  
### **Introduction:**  
**Pseudocode** is a way of writing algorithms in plain English mixed with programming-like structures. It **doesn’t follow the syntax of a real programming language** but helps programmers plan their logic before writing actual code.

### **Key Concepts:**  
1. **What is pseudocode?** – A human-readable way to describe algorithms.  
2. **Basic pseudocode syntax (Variables, Loops, Conditionals).**  
3. **How pseudocode translates into real programming languages.**

### **Example:**  
**Pseudocode for checking if a number is even or odd:**  
```
BEGIN  
   INPUT number  
   IF number MOD 2 = 0 THEN  
      PRINT "Even"  
   ELSE  
      PRINT "Odd"  
   ENDIF  
END  
```

### **Critical Thinking & Research Questions:**  
1. **Why is pseudocode useful before writing actual code in a programming language?**  

    Pseudocode helps you plan and visualize the logic of your program without worrying about specific syntax. It allows you to focus on the steps needed to solve a problem, making it easier to identify errors and refine your approach before coding.

2. **How does pseudocode differ from real programming languages like Python or JavaScript?**  

    Pseudocode: Uses plain language and simple structures to describe algorithms, making it easy to understand and independent of any programming language.

    Programming Languages: Have strict syntax and rules that must be followed to create executable code.

    Pseudocode serves as an intermediary step, helping to outline the logic before translating it into a specific programming language.

3. **What are some best practices for writing clear and understandable pseudocode?**  

    - Use Simple Language: Write in plain English to ensure clarity.
    - Be Consistent: Use consistent terminology and formatting throughout.
    - Focus on Logic: Concentrate on the steps and decisions, not on syntax.
    - Indent Properly: Use indentation to show the structure and flow of the algorithm.
    - Review and Refine: Regularly check and improve your pseudocode for clarity and accuracy.

4. **Write a pseudocode to checking if a number is even or odd?**  

    1. Start
    2. Input number n
    3. If n MOD 2 = 0 then
            Output "Even"
        Else
            Output "Odd"
    4. End

5. **How would you write pseudocode to calculate the sum of all numbers in a list?**  

    1. Start
    2. Initialize total = 0
    3. For each number in the list
        Add number to total
    4. Output total
    5. End

6. **What is the difference between sequential execution, selection (IF-ELSE), and iteration (loops) in pseudocode?**  

    - Sequential Execution: Steps are performed one after another in the order they appear.
    - Selection (IF-ELSE): Allows the program to choose between different paths based on conditions.
    - Iteration (Loops): Repeats a set of steps multiple times until a condition is met.
