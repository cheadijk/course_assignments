## **Instructions**  
**Objective:** The goal of this exercise is to help you understand the concept of APIs, how they function in retrieving data, and their significance in web scraping tasks.

By the end of this exercise, you will gain the skills to utilize APIs effectively, learn the importance of reading documentation, and understand key terms like API keys, JSON, endpoints, and rate limits. ðŸš€

## **Questions**  
1. **What is an API, and how does it help get data from websites?**  

    An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules that allows one software application to interact with another. It enables developers to access data or services from other applications or websites. For example, a weather app can use an API to retrieve weather information from a weather service.

2. **Why do some websites offer APIs instead of letting people copy data directly?**  

    Websites provide APIs to allow controlled access to their data. APIs ensure that data is accessed in a structured and secure manner, preventing overload on the website's servers and protecting sensitive information.

3. **What is an endpoint in an API?**  

    An endpoint is a specific URL where an API can access the resources it needs. Each endpoint corresponds to a particular function or data set, like retrieving user information or posting a comment.

4. **What is a GET request?**  

    A GET request is a method used by APIs to retrieve data from a server. For example, when you search for something on a website, your browser sends a GET request to the server to fetch the search results.

5. **What is an API key?**  

    An API key is a unique identifier used to authenticate a user or application when making API requests. It helps the API provider track usage and ensure that only authorized users can access the data.

6. **What is JSON?**  

    JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight, text-based format used to store and exchange data. It's easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. APIs often use JSON to send data between servers and clients.

7. **What does "rate limit" mean?**  

    A rate limit is a restriction set by an API provider on how many times a user or application can make requests to the API in a given period. This helps prevent abuse and ensures fair usage among all users.

8. **What is Postman?**  

    Postman is a popular tool used by developers to test and interact with APIs. It allows users to send requests to APIs and view responses, making it easier to develop and debug API integrations.

9. **Why is it important to read the documentation before using an API?**  

    Reading the API documentation is crucial because it provides detailed information on how to use the API correctly. It explains the available endpoints, required parameters, authentication methods, and any limitations or restrictions.

10. **What are query parameters?**  

    Query parameters are additional pieces of information added to the end of a URL to specify or filter the data being requested. For example, in the URL https://api.example.com/users?id=123, id=123 is a query parameter that specifies which user's data to retrieve.
